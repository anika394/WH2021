        <p>After some Googling, I found that I should use the memory forensics framework ‘Volatility’ in order to capture the flag. After installing Volatility, I extracted some basic information about the image using the imageinfo command.</p>
        <img src='22.png'>
        <p>Then I supplied a profile (Win7SP1x64) to Volatility and using pstree, I listed the processes that were running on the machine when the RAM image was made.</p>
        <img src='33.png'>
        <p>Since this is a Windows machine, the attacker probably left a link in a notepad so I used the grep command to list out all the notepad.exe processes.</p>
        <img src='44.png'>
        <p>There were four notepad.exe processes so proceeded to dump the data from each notepad.exe process into a directory using memdump.</p>
        <img src='55.png'>
        <p>Then I used strings and grep to search for URLs. The first dump yielded no obvious or interesting URLs. However, the second dump looked promising.</p>
        <img src='66.png'>
        <p>There was an Imgur link, surely the image of the flag must be there?</p>
        <img src='77.png'>
        <p>Sure enough after going to https://imgur.com/a/pRWCNyo , the image of the flag was there.</p>

        <p>Since I had any prior experience or knowledge regarding CTFs or cybersecurity in general, going into the competition, I thought that I would not be able to solve anything. At first every single task seemed daunting. Though with some patience (alot of patience), luck and Googling (the most important skill), I managed to finish a few challenges. 

            This was my first CTF and I thoroughly enjoyed it - the gamified style of competition makes capturing a flag so, so, so extremely satisfying! I learnt a plethora of new things from the workshop, pre training materials and the event itself - how to use Kali, compile C source code, SQL injections and so much, much more.
            
            In fact I liked the event so much that the following weekend I participated in another CTF and am looking forward to playing in many more. Thanks Whitehacks for exposing me to a whole new world!
